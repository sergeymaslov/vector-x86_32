# manually preparing the environment to allow insecure registries, and it can
# also not work if you k8s cluster doesn't have network connectivity to the

#
# Hint #2: if using with minikube, set `USE_MINIKUBE_DOCKER` to `true` and use
# any value for `CONTAINER_IMAGE_REPO` (for instance, `vector-test` will do).

# we'll be exporting it to a file after (from the "host" docker engine), and
# then importing that file into the minikube in-cluster docker engine, that
# nodes have access to.
# This effectively eliminates the requirement to have a docker registry, but
# it requires that we run against minikube cluster.
