The [sidecar deployment strategy][docs.strategies#sidecar] is designed to
collect data from a _single_ service. Vector has a tight 1 to 1 coupling with
each service. Typically data is collected by tailing local files via Vector's
[`file` source][docs.sources.file], but can be collected through any of Vector's
[sources][docs.sources]. The following diagram demonstrates how it works.
