### Configuring

The Vector configuration file is located at:

```text
config/vector.toml
```

A full spec is located at `config/vector.spec.toml` and examples are
located in `config/vector/examples/*`. You can learn more about configuring
Vector in the [Configuration][docs.configuration] section.

### Data Directory

We highly recommend creating a [data directory][docs.global-options#data_dir]
that Vector can use:

```bash
mkdir /var/lib/vector
```

<Alert type="warning">

Make sure that this directory is writable by the `vector` process.

</Alert>

Vector offers a global [`data_dir` option][docs.global-options#data_dir] that
you can use to specify the path of your directory.

```toml title="vector.toml"
data_dir = "/var/lib/vector" # default
```

### Service Managers

Vector archives ship with service files in case you need them:

#### Init.d

To install Vector into Init.d run:

```bash
cp -av <%= distribution_dir %>/init.d/vector /etc/init.d
```

#### Systemd

To install Vector into Systemd run:

```bash
cp -av <%= distribution_dir %>/systemd/vector.service /etc/systemd/system
```
