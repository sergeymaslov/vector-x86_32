<%= guide.events_phrase.capitalize %> are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your <%= guide.events_phrase %>, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your <%= guide.events_phrase %> pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send <%= guide.action_phrase %>
and build a <%= guide.events_phrase %> pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

<%- if platform && platform.description -%>
### What is <%= platform.title %>?

<%= platform.description %>

<%- elsif source && source.description -%>
### What is <%= source.title %>?

<%= source.description %>

<%- end -%>
<%- if sink && sink.description -%>
### What is <%= sink.title %>?

<%= sink.description %>

<%- end -%>
<%- end -%>
## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Vector as a
[<%= strategy.name %>][docs.strategies#<%= strategy.name %>].

<%= deployment_strategy(strategy, platform: platform, sink: sink, source: source) %>

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ul className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">
  <%- guide.features.each do |feature| -%>
  <li>
    <%= feature.text %>
    <%- if feature.features.any? -%>
    <ul>
      <%- feature.features.each do |feature| -%>
      <li><%= feature.text %></li>
      <%- end -%>
    </ul>
    <%- end -%>
  </li>
  <%- end -%>
  <li className="list--icons--arrow text--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ul>

## Next Steps

Vector is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Vector:
