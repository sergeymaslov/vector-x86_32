The `filter` transform is a simple conditional match, forwarding only those messages that pass all the conditions.
In this example, we drop all events that do not come from the host `gerry`:

```toml title="vector.toml"
[transforms.from_gerry]
  inputs = [ "somewhere" ]
  type = "filter"

  [transforms.from_gerry.condition]
    "host.eq" = "gerry"

[sinks.only_gerry]
  inputs = [ "from_gerry" ]
  type = "something"
```

Any event that does not match all of the conditions in the filter will be dropped by the transform.
