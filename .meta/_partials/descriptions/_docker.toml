[Docker][urls.docker] is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running
applications and services. Docker enables you to separate your services from \
your infrastructure so you can ship quickly. With Docker, you can manage your \
infrastructure in the same ways you manage your services. By taking advantage \
of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, \
you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in \
production.\
