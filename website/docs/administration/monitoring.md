## Logs

### Accessing

<Tabs
  block={false}
  centered={true}
  groupId="interfaces"
  placeholder="How did you install Vector?"
  select={true}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Package managers","label":"DPKG","value":"dpkg"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Docker CLI","value":"docker-cli"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Docker Compose","value":"docker-compose"},{"group":"Package managers","label":"Homebrew","value":"homebrew"},{"group":"Package managers","label":"MSI","value":"msi"},{"group":"Package managers","label":"Nix","value":"nix"},{"group":"Package managers","label":"RPM","value":"rpm"},{"group":"Nones","label":"Vector CLI","value":"vector-cli"}]}>
<TabItem value="dpkg">

The Vector DEB package installs Vector as a Systemd service. Logs can be
accessed through the `journalctl` utility:

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu vector
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker-cli">

If you've started Vector through the `docker` CLI you can access Vector's logs
via the `docker logs` command. First, find the Vector container ID:

```bash
docker ps | grep vector
```

Copy Vector's container ID and use it to tail the logs:

```bash
docker logs -f <container-id>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker-compose">

If you started Vector through Docker compose you can use the following command
to access Vector's logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f vector
```

Replace `vector` with the name of Vector's service if it is not called `vector`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

When Vector is started through Homebrew the logs are automatically routed to
`/usr/local/var/log/vector.log`. You can tail them with the `tail` utility:

```bash
tail -f /usr/local/var/log/vector.log
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="msi">

The Vector MSI package does not install Vector into a proces manager. Therefore,
Vector must be started by executing the Vector binary directly. Vector's logs
are written to `STDOUT`. You are in charge of routing `STDOUT`, and this
determines how you access Vector's logs.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nix">

The Vector Nix package does not install Vector into a proces manager. Therefore,
Vector must be started by executing the Vector binary directly. Vector's logs
are written to `STDOUT`. You are in charge of routing `STDOUT`, and this
determines how you access Vector's logs.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rpm">

The Vector RPM package installs Vector as a Systemd service. Logs can be
accessed through the `journalctl` utility:

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu vector
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vector-cli">

If you are starting Vector directly from the Vector CLI then all logs will be
written to `STDOUT`. You are in charge of routing `STDOUT`, and this determines
how you access Vector's logs.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Levels

By default, Vector logs on the `info` level, you can change the level through
a variety of methods:

| Method                                       | Description                                                                         |
|:---------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`-v` flag][docs.process-management#flags]   | Drops the log level to `debug`.                                                     |
| [`-vv` flag][docs.process-management#flags]  | Drops the log level to `trace`.                                                     |
| [`-q` flag][docs.process-management#flags]   | Raises the log level to `warn`.                                                     |
| [`-qq` flag][docs.process-management#flags]  | Raises the log level to `error`.                                                    |
| [`-qqq` flag][docs.process-management#flags] | Turns logging off.                                                                  |
| `LOG=<level>` env var                        | Set the log level. Must be one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `off`. |

### Full Backtraces

You can enable full error backtraces by setting the  `RUST_BACKTRACE=full` env
var. More on this in the [Troubleshooting guide][guides.advanced.troubleshooting].

### Rate Limiting

Vector rate limits log events in the hot path. This is to your benefit as
it allows you to get granular insight without the risk of saturating IO
and disrupting the service. The tradeoff is that repetitive logs will not be
logged.

## Metrics

Currently, Vector does not expose Metrics. [Issue #230][urls.issue_230]
represents work to run internal Vector metrics through Vector's pipeline.
Allowing you to define internal metrics as a [source][docs.sources] and
then define one of many metrics [sinks][docs.sinks] to collect those metrics,
just as you would metrics from any other source.
