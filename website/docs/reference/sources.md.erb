Sources are responsible for ingesting [events][docs.data-model] into
Vector, they can both receive and pull in data. If you're deploying Vector as
a [daemon][docs.strategies#daemon] or [sidecar][docs.strategies#sidecar], you'll
want to user local data sources like the [`file`][docs.sources.file] or
[`stdin`][docs.sources.stdin] sources. If you're deploying Vector as a
[service][docs.strategies#service], you'll want to use sources that receive data
over the network, like the [`vector`][docs.sources.vector],
[`socket`][docs.sources.socket], and [`syslog`][docs.sources.syslog] sources.
