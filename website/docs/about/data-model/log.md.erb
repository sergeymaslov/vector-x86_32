## Description

A `log` event is a structured represention of a point-in-time event. It contains
an arbitrary set of fields (key/value pairs) that describe the event.

## Examples

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  block={true}
  defaultValue="default"
  values={[
    { label: 'Default Schema', value: 'default', },
    { label: 'Custom Fields', value: 'custom', },
    { label: 'Nested Fields', value: 'nested', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="default">

```js
{
  "host": "my.host.com",
  "message": "<13>Feb 13 20:07:26 74794bfb6795 root[8539]: i am foobar",
  "timestamp": "2019-11-01T21:15:47+00:00"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="custom">

```js
{
  "host": "my.host.com",
  "message": "<13>Feb 13 20:07:26 74794bfb6795 root[8539]: i am foobar",
  "timestamp": "2019-11-01T21:15:47+00:00",
  "custom_field": "custom_value" // custom keys are allowed
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="nested">

```js
{
  "host": "my.host.com",
  "message": "<13>Feb 13 20:07:26 74794bfb6795 root[8539]: i am foobar",
  "timestamp": "2019-11-01T21:15:47+00:00",
  "parent": {
    "child": "child_value"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Schema

<Alert type="info">

The following fields are the _default_ schema. All of these field names can be
changed via the
[global `log_schema` options][docs.reference.global-options#log_schema].

## How It Works

### Changing The Default Schema

Vector is unique in that you are not required to use a specific schema. You
can change the default schema. This makes integrating Vector into existing
pipelines much easier. The `message`, `host`, and `timestamp` field names can
all be changed via the
[global `log_schema` options][docs.reference.global-options#log_schema].

#### Field name collisions

When you send structured data to Vector your field names always take precedence.
For example, if you send a JSON object with a `timestamp` key, Vector will
_not_ override the value of that field. Vector will only set that field if it
is not present.

### Time Zones

If Vector receives a timestamp that does not contain timezone information
Vector assumes the timestamp is in local time, and will convert the timestamp
to UTC from the local time.

### Dot Notation

Some components, such as [`rename_fields` transform][docs.reference.transforms.rename_fields],
accept name of a field as an option. In order to specify a nested field to them, use the
dot notation which can be described by an example:

```text
parent_field.child_field
```

The dot notation also supports accessing array fields using by placing the index between
`[` and `]` after the array field name, for example

```text
array[0]
```

The indexes start from 0, missing values are auto-filled by [null values](#null-values).

<Alert type="warning">

It is important that the host system contain time zone data files to properly
determine the local time zone. This is typically installed through the `tzdata`
package. See [issue 551][urls.issue_551] for more info.

</Alert>

### Timestamp Coercion

There are cases where Vector interacts with formats that do not have a formal
timestamp defintion, such as JSON. In these cases, Vector will ingest the
timestamp in it's primitive form (string or integer). You can then coerce the
field into a `timestamp` using the
[`coercer` transform][docs.transforms.coercer]. If you are parsing this data
out of a string, all Vector parser transforms include a `types` option,
allowing you to extract and coerce in one step.

### Types

#### Strings

Strings are UTF-8 compatible and are only bounded by the available system
memory.

#### Ints

Integers are signed integers up to 64 bits.

#### Floats

Floats are 64-bit [IEEE 754][urls.ieee_754] floats.

#### Booleans

Booleans represent binary true/false values.

#### Timestamps

Timestamps are represented as [`DateTime` Rust structs][urls.rust_date_time]
stored as UTC.

#### Null Values

For compatibility with JSON log events, Vector also supports `null` values.

#### Maps

Maps are associative arrays mapping string fields to values of any type.

#### Arrays

Array fields are sequences of values of any type.
