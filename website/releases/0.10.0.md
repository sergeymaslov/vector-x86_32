## What's Next

<ul className="connected-list">
<li>

### Kubernetes! ‚éà

We're doing this integration right. We've been alpha testing with a number of large clusters and we've honed in on a very high-quality approach that reflects the UX Vector is going after. You can learn more in our [Kubernetes Integration RFC][urls.pr_2222]. Do you want to beta test? [Tell us!][urls.vector_chat]
</li>
<li>

### WASM plugins üîå

This release included an experimental implementation of a WASM transform behind a `wasm` build flag. We plan to stabilize WASM transforms, as well as add [WASM][urls.wasm] sinks and sources, enabling you to extend Vector in the language of your choice with little performance penalty. ‚ù§Ô∏è WASM. Check out the [WASM Plugin RFC][urls.pr_2341] for more info.

### Dynamic HTTP Rate-Limiting (AIMD)

Fiddling with rate-limits is a frustrating endaevor. If you set them too high you risk overwhelming the service; too low and you're unecessarily limiting throughput. What happens if you deploy a few more Vector instances? Vector is planning to solve this by automatically detecting the optimal rate limits, taking inspiration from TCP congestional control algorithms. Check out the [Dynamic HTTP Rate Limiting RFC][urls.pr_2329].
</li>
</ul>

The [Vector roadmap][urls.vector_roadmap] is publicly available and represents
forward looking progress. Vector is [open-source][urls.vector_repo] and
[community driven][pages.community]. Your feedback is welcome!
