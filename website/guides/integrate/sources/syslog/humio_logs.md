Logs are an _essential_ part of observing any
service; without them you are flying blind. But collecting and analyzing them
can be a real challenge -- especially at scale. Not only do you need to solve
the basic task of collecting your logs, but you must do it
in a reliable, performant, and robust manner. Nothing is more frustrating than
having your logs pipeline fall on it's face during an
outage, or even worse, disrupt more important services!

Fear not! In this guide we'll show you how to send send logs from [Syslog][urls.syslog] to [Humio][urls.humio]
and build a logs pipeline that will be the backbone of
your observability strategy.

## Background

### What is Syslog?

[Syslog][urls.syslog] stands for System Logging Protocol and is a standard protocol used to send system log or event messages to a specific server, called a syslog server. It is primarily used to collect various device logs from several different machines in a central location for monitoring and review.

### What is Humio Logs?

[Humio][urls.humio] is a time-series logging and aggregation platform for unrestricted, comprehensive event analysis, On-Premises or in the Cloud. With 1TB/day of raw log ingest/node, in-memory stream processing, and live, shareable dashboards and alerts, you can instantly and in real-time explore, monitor, and visualize any systemâ€™s data.

## Strategy

### How This Guide Works

We'll be using [Vector][urls.vector_website] to accomplish this task. Vector
is a [popular][urls.vector_stars] [open-source][urls.vector_repo] utility for
building observability pipelines. It's written in [Rust][urls.rust], making it
lightweight, [ultra-fast][urls.vector_performance] and highly reliable. And
we'll be deploying Vector as a
[service][docs.strategies#service].

The [service deployment strategy][docs.strategies#service] treats Vector like a
separate service. It is designed to receive data from an upstream source and
fan-out to one or more destinations.
For this guide, Vector will receive data from
Syslog via Vector's
[`syslog` source][docs.sources.syslog].
The following diagram demonstrates how it works.

<ServiceDiagram
  platformName={null}
  sourceName={"syslog"}
  sinkName={"humio_logs"} />

### What We'll Accomplish

To be clear, here's everything we'll accomplish in this short guide:

<ul className="list--icons list--icons--checks list--indent">
  <li>
    Accept log data over the Syslog protocol via TCP, UDP, or Unix sockets.
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically parse Syslog 3164 and 5424 formats.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Send logs to the Humio logging service.
    <ul>
      <li>Batch data to maximize throughput.</li>
      <li>Automatically retry failed requests, with backoff.</li>
      <li>Buffer your data in-memory or on-disk for performance and durability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li className="list--icons--arrow text--pink text--bold">All in just a few minutes!</li>
</ul>

## Tutorial

<Steps headingDepth={3}>
<ol>
<li>

### Install Vector

<InstallationCommand />

Or choose your [preferred method][docs.installation].

</li>
<li>

### Configure Vector

<ConfigExample
  format="toml"
  path={"vector.toml"}
  sourceName={"syslog"}
  sinkName={"humio_logs"} />

</li>
<li>

### Start Vector

```bash
vector --config vector.toml
```

That's it! Simple and to the point. Hit `ctrl+c` to exit.

</li>
</ol>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Vector is _powerful_ utility and we're just scratching the surface in this
guide. Here are a few pages we recommend that demonstrate the power and
flexibility of Vector:
