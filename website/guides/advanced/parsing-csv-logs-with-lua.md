import Assumptions from '@site/src/components/Assumptions';

<Assumptions>

* You understand the [basic Lua concepts][docs.reference.transforms.lua].
* You understand the [basic Vector concepts][docs.about.concepts] and understand [how to set up a pipeline][guides.getting-started.your-first-pipeline].

</Assumptions>

Vector has many built-in [parsers][pages.parse_transforms] for structured logs formats. However, when you need to ship
logs in a custom or application-specific format, [programmable transforms][pages.program_transforms] have got you
covered.

This guide walks through reading CSV logs using [`file`][docs.reference.sources.file] source and parsing them using
[`lua`][docs.reference.transforms.lua] transform with a loadable Lua module.

## Getting Started

For certainty, it is assumed in the following that the logs to be read are produced by
[`csvlog`][urls.postgresql_csvlog] in PostgreSQL. For example, there might be the following
log file:


```csv title="log.csv"
2020-04-09 12:48:49.661 UTC,,,1,,localhost.1,1,,2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC,,0,LOG,00000,"ending log output to stderr",,"Future log output will go to log destination ""csvlog"".",,,,,,,""
2020-04-09 12:48:49.669 UTC,,,27,,localhost.1b,1,,2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC,,0,LOG,00000,"database system was shut down at 2020-04-09 12:48:25 UTC",,,,,,,,,""
2020-04-09 12:48:49.683 UTC,,,1,,localhost.1,2,,2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC,,0,LOG,00000,"database system is ready to accept connections",,,,,,,,,""
```

Let us draft an initial version of the Vector's configuration file:

```toml title="vector.toml"
data_dir = "."

[sources.file]
  type = "file"
  include = ["*.csv"]
  start_at_beginning = true

[transforms.lua]
  inputs = ["file"]
  type = "lua"
  version = "2"
  hooks.process = """
    function (event, emit)
      -- to be expanded
      emit(event)
    end
  """

[sinks.console]
  inputs = ["lua"]
  type = "console"
  encoding = "json"
```

This config sets up a [pipeline][docs.meta.glossary#pipeline] that reads log files, pipes them through the parsing
transform (which currently is configured to just pass the events through), and displays the produced log events using
[`console`][docs.reference.sinks.console] sink.

At this point, running `vector --config vector.toml` results in the following output:

```json
{"file":"log.csv","host":"localhost","message":"2020-04-09 12:48:49.661 UTC,,,1,,localhost.1,1,,2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC,,0,LOG,00000,\"ending log output to stderr\",,\"Future log output will go to log destination \"\"csvlog\"\".\",,,,,,,\"\"","timestamp":"2020-04-09T14:33:28Z"}
{"file":"log.csv","host":"localhost","message":"2020-04-09 12:48:49.669 UTC,,,27,,localhost.1b,1,,2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC,,0,LOG,00000,\"database system was shut down at 2020-04-09 12:48:25 UTC\",,,,,,,,,\"\"","timestamp":"2020-04-09T14:33:28Z"}
{"file":"log.csv","host":"localhost","message":"2020-04-09 12:48:49.683 UTC,,,1,,localhost.1,2,,2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC,,0,LOG,00000,\"database system is ready to accept connections\",,,,,,,,,\"\"","timestamp":"2020-04-09T14:33:28Z"}
```

## Adding the CSV Module

In order to perform actual parsing, it is possible to leverage [`lua-csv`][urls.lua_csv_repo].
Because it consists of a [single file][urls.lua_csv_view], it is possible to just download it to the same
directory where `vector.toml` is stored:

```bash
curl -o csv.lua https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoffleyland/lua-csv/d20cd42d61dc52e7f6bcb13b596ac7a7d4282fbf/lua/csv.lua
```

Then it would be possible to load it by calling [`require`][urls.lua_require] Lua function in the
[`source`][docs.reference.transforms.lua#source] configuration section:

```toml
source = """
  csv = require("csv")
"""
```

With this `source` the `csv` module is loaded when Vector is started up (or if the `lua` transform is added later and the
config is [automatically reloaded][docs.administration.process-management#automatic-reload-on-changes]) and can
be used through the global variable `csv`.

## Implementing Custom Parsing

With the `csv` module, the [`hooks.process`][docs.reference.transforms.lua#process] can be changed to the following:

```toml
hooks.process = """
  function (event, emit)
    fields = csv.openstring(event.log.message):lines()() -- parse the `message` field
    event.log.message = nil -- drop the `message` field

    column_names = {  -- a sequence containing CSV column names
      -- ...
    }

    for column, value in ipairs(fields) do -- iterate over CSV columns
      column_name = column_names[column] -- get column name
      event.log[column_name] = value -- set the corresponding field in the event
    end

    emit(event) -- emit the transformed event
  end
"""
```

Note that the `column_names` can be created just once, in the `source` section instead to speed up processing.
Putting it there and using the column names from the PostgreSQL documentation results in the following definition of
the whole transform:

```toml title="vector.toml"
# ...
[transforms.lua]
  inputs = ["file"]
  type = "lua"
  version = "2"
  source = """
    csv = require("csv") -- load external module for parsing CSV
    column_names = {  -- a sequence containing CSV column names
      "log_time",
      "user_name",
      "database_name",
      "process_id",
      "connection_from",
      "session_id",
      "session_line_num",
      "command_tag",
      "session_start_time",
      "virtual_transaction_id",
      "transaction_id",
      "error_severity",
      "sql_state_code",
      "message",
      "detail",
      "hint",
      "internal_query",
      "internal_query_pos",
      "context",
      "query",
      "query_pos",
      "location",
      "application_name",
    }
  """
  hooks.process = """
    function (event, emit)
      fields = csv.openstring(event.log.message):lines()() -- parse the `message` field
      event.log.message = nil -- drop the `message` field

      for column, value in ipairs(fields) do -- iterate over CSV columns
        column_name = column_names[column] -- get column name
        event.log[column_name] = value -- set the corresponding field in the event
      end

      emit(event) -- emit the transformed event
    end
    """
#...
```

Trying to run `vector --config vector.toml` with the same input file results in structured events being output:

```json
{"application_name":"","command_tag":"","connection_from":"","context":"","database_name":"","detail":"","error_severity":"LOG","file":"log.csv","hint":"Future log output will go to log destination \"csvlog\".","host":"localhost","internal_query":"","internal_query_pos":"","location":"","log_time":"2020-04-09 12:48:49.661 UTC","message":"ending log output to stderr","process_id":"1","query":"","query_pos":"","session_id":"localhost.1","session_line_num":"1","session_start_time":"2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC","sql_state_code":"00000","timestamp":"2020-04-09T19:49:07Z","transaction_id":"0","user_name":"","virtual_transaction_id":""}
{"application_name":"","command_tag":"","connection_from":"","context":"","database_name":"","detail":"","error_severity":"LOG","file":"log.csv","hint":"","host":"localhost","internal_query":"","internal_query_pos":"","location":"","log_time":"2020-04-09 12:48:49.669 UTC","message":"database system was shut down at 2020-04-09 12:48:25 UTC","process_id":"27","query":"","query_pos":"","session_id":"localhost.1b","session_line_num":"1","session_start_time":"2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC","sql_state_code":"00000","timestamp":"2020-04-09T19:49:07Z","transaction_id":"0","user_name":"","virtual_transaction_id":""}
{"application_name":"","command_tag":"","connection_from":"","context":"","database_name":"","detail":"","error_severity":"LOG","file":"log.csv","hint":"","host":"localhost","internal_query":"","internal_query_pos":"","location":"","log_time":"2020-04-09 12:48:49.683 UTC","message":"database system is ready to accept connections","process_id":"1","query":"","query_pos":"","session_id":"localhost.1","session_line_num":"2","session_start_time":"2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC","sql_state_code":"00000","timestamp":"2020-04-09T19:49:07Z","transaction_id":"0","user_name":"","virtual_transaction_id":""}
```

Or, applying pretty formatting to one of the output events:

```json
{
  "application_name": "",
  "command_tag": "",
  "connection_from": "",
  "context": "",
  "database_name": "",
  "detail": "",
  "error_severity": "LOG",
  "file": "log.csv",
  "hint": "Future log output will go to log destination \"csvlog\".",
  "host": "localhost",
  "internal_query": "",
  "internal_query_pos": "",
  "location": "",
  "log_time": "2020-04-09 12:48:49.661 UTC",
  "message": "ending log output to stderr",
  "process_id": "1",
  "query": "",
  "query_pos": "",
  "session_id": "localhost.1",
  "session_line_num": "1",
  "session_start_time": "2020-04-09 12:48:49 UTC",
  "sql_state_code": "00000",
  "timestamp": "2020-04-09T19:49:07Z",
  "transaction_id": "0",
  "user_name": "",
  "virtual_transaction_id": ""
}
```

## Further Improvements

After the task of parsing the CSV logs is accomplished, the following improvements can take place.

### Support for Multi-line Strings

CSV supports line breaks in strings. However, by default `file` source creates a separate event from each line.

There are two options to deal with this:

1. For simple cases it might be possible to use the [`multiline`][docs.reference.sources.file#multiline] configuration
  option in the `file` source.
2. For more complex cases the messages from multiple events can be conditionally concatenated in the Lua code. See
  [the aggregations guide][guides.advanced.custom-aggregations-with-lua] for more details on this.


### Change Fields Types

By default, all columns are parsed as strings. It is possible to convert them to other
[data types][docs.reference.transforms.lua#data-types] right in the Lua code using
built-in functions, such as [`tonumber`][urls.lua_tonumber]. Alternatively, it is possible to add the
[`coercer`][docs.reference.transforms.coercer] transform after the `lua` transform, for example, to
[parse timestamps][docs.reference.transforms.coercer#timestamps].
