Structured logs are like cocktails; they're cool because they're complicated.
In this guide we'll build a pipeline using [transformations][docs.transforms]
that allows us to send unstructured [events][docs.data-model] through it that
look like this:

```text
172.128.80.109 - Bins5273 656 [2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00] \"PUT /mesh\" 406 10272
```

And have them coming out the other end in a structured format like this:

```json
{
  "bytes_in":"656",
  "timestamp":"2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00",
  "method":"PUT",
  "bytes_out":"10272",
  "host":"172.128.80.109",
  "status":"406",
  "user":"Bins5273",
  "path":"/mesh"
}
```

### Setup a basic pipeline

In the last guide we simply piped stdin to stdout, I'm not trying to diminish
your sense of achievement but that was pretty basic.

This time we're going to build a config we might use in the real world. It's
going to consume logs over TCP with a [`socket` source][docs.sources.socket] and
write them to an [`elasticsearch` sink][docs.sinks.elasticsearch].

<Alert type="info">

There's no need to run a local Elasticsearch for this guide as we can write and
even test our config without connecting to sources or sinks (as you'll see).

</Alert>

The basic source to sink version of our pipeline looks like this:

```toml title="vector.toml"
[sources.foo]
  type = "socket"
  address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
  mode = "tcp"

[sinks.bar]
  inputs = ["foo"]
  type = "elasticsearch"
  index = "example-index"
  host = "http://10.24.32.122:9000"
```

If we were to run it then the raw data we consume over TCP would be captured in
the field `message`, and the object we'd publish to Elasticsearch would look
like this:

```json title="log event"
{"message":"172.128.80.109 - Bins5273 656 [2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00] \"PUT /mesh\" 406 10272","host":"foo","timestamp":"2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00"}
```

That's hardly structured at all! Let's remedy that by adding our first transform.

</li>
<li>

### Add a parsing transform

Nothing in this world is ever good enough for you, why should events be any
different?

Vector makes it easy to mutate events into a more (or less) structured format
with [transforms][docs.transforms]. Let's parse our logs into a structured
format by capturing named regular expression groups with a
[`regex_parser` transform][docs.transforms.regex_parser].

A config can have any number of transforms and it's entirely up to you how they
are chained together. Similar to sinks, a transform requires you to specify
where its data comes from. When a sink is configured to accept data from a
transform the pipeline is complete.

Let's place our new transform in between our existing source and sink:

<Tabs
  block={true}
  defaultValue="diff"
  values={[
    { label: 'Diff', value: 'diff', },
    { label: 'Full Config', value: 'new_result', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="diff">

```diff title="vector.toml"
 [sources.foo]
   type = "socket"
   address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
   mode = "tcp"


+[transforms.apache_parser]
+  inputs = ["foo"]
+  type = "regex_parser"
+  field = "message"
+  regex = '^(?P<host>[\w\.]+) - (?P<user>[\w]+) (?P<bytes_in>[\d]+) \[(?P<timestamp>.*)\] "(?P<mathod>[\w]+) (?P<path>.*)" (?P<status>[\d]+) (?P<bytes_out>[\d]+)$'
+
 [sinks.bar]
-  inputs = ["foo"]
+  inputs = ["apache_parser"]
   type = "elasticsearch"
   index = "example-index"
   host = "http://10.24.32.122:9000"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="new_result">

```toml title="vector.toml"
[sources.foo]
  type = "socket"
  address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
  mode = "tcp"

[transforms.apache_parser]
  inputs = ["foo"]
  type = "regex_parser"
  field = "message"
  regex = '^(?P<host>[\w\.]+) - (?P<user>[\w]+) (?P<bytes_in>[\d]+) \[(?P<timestamp>.*)\] "(?P<mathod>[\w]+) (?P<path>.*)" (?P<status>[\d]+) (?P<bytes_out>[\d]+)$'

[sinks.bar]
  inputs = ["apache_parser"]
  type = "elasticsearch"
  index = "example-index"
  host = "http://10.24.32.122:9000"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This regular expression looks great and it probably works, but it's best to be
sure, right? Which leads us onto the next step.

<li>

### Test it

No one is saying that unplanned explosions aren't cool, but you should be doing
that in your own time. In order to test our transform we _could_ set up a local
Elasticsearch instance and run the whole pipeline, but that's an awful bother
and Vector has a much better way.

Instead, we can write [unit tests][guides.advanced.unit_testing] as part of our
config just like you would for regular code:

<Tabs
  block={true}
  defaultValue="diff"
  values={[
    { label: 'Diff', value: 'diff', },
    { label: 'Full Config', value: 'new_result', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="diff">

```diff title="vector.toml"
# Write the data
[sinks.bar]
  inputs = ["apache_parser"]
  type = "elasticsearch"
  index = "example-index"
  host = "http://10.24.32.122:9000"
+
+[[tests]]
+  name = "test apache regex"
+
+  [[tests.inputs]]
+    insert_at = "apache_parser"
+    type = "raw"
+    value = "172.128.80.109 - Bins5273 656 [2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00] \"PUT /mesh\" 406 10272"
+
+  [[tests.outputs]]
+    extract_from = "apache_parser"
+    [[tests.outputs.conditions]]
+      type = "check_fields"
+      "method.eq" = "PUT"
+      "host.eq" = "172.128.80.109"
+      "timestamp.eq" = "2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00"
+      "path.eq" = "/mesh"
+      "status.eq" = "406"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="new_result">

```toml title="vector.toml"
# Consume data
[sources.foo]
  type = "socket"
  address = "0.0.0.0:9000"
  mode = "tcp"

# Structure the data
[transforms.apache_parser]
  inputs = ["foo"]
  type = "regex_parser"
  field = "message"
  regex = '^(?P<host>[\w\.]+) - (?P<user>[\w]+) (?P<bytes_in>[\d]+) \[(?P<timestamp>.*)\] "(?P<mathod>[\w]+) (?P<path>.*)" (?P<status>[\d]+) (?P<bytes_out>[\d]+)$'

# Write the data
[sinks.bar]
  inputs = ["apache_parser"]
  type = "elasticsearch"
  index = "example-index"
  host = "http://10.24.32.122:9000"

[[tests]]
  name = "test apache regex"

  [[tests.inputs]]
    insert_at = "apache_parser"
    type = "raw"
    value = "172.128.80.109 - Bins5273 656 [2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00] \"PUT /mesh\" 406 10272"

  [[tests.outputs]]
    extract_from = "apache_parser"
    [[tests.outputs.conditions]]
      type = "check_fields"
      "method.eq" = "PUT"
      "host.eq" = "172.128.80.109"
      "timestamp.eq" = "2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00"
      "path.eq" = "/mesh"
      "status.eq" = "406"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This unit test spec has a name, defines an input event to feed into our pipeline
at a specific transform (in this case our _only_ transform), and defines where
we'd like to capture resulting events coming out along with a condition to check
the events against.

When we run:

```bash
vector test ./vector.toml
```

It will parse and execute our test:

```text
Running vector.toml tests
test vector.toml: test apache regex ... failed

failures:

--- vector.toml ---

test 'test apache regex':

check transform 'apache_parser' failed conditions:
  condition[0]: predicates failed: [ method.eq: "PUT" ]
payloads (events encoded as JSON):
  input: {"timestamp":"2020-02-20T10:19:27.283745Z","message":"172.128.80.109 - Bins5273 656 [2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00] \"PUT /mesh\" 406 10272"}
  output: {"bytes_in":"656","timestamp":"2019-05-03T13:11:48-04:00","mathod":"PUT","bytes_out":"10272","host":"172.128.80.109","status":"406","user":"Bins5273","path":"/mesh"}
```

By Jove! There _was_ a problem with our regular expression! Our test has pointed
out that the predicate `method.eq` failed, and has helpfully printed our input
and resulting events in JSON format.

This allows us to inspect exactly what our transform is doing, and it turns out
that the method from our Apache log is actually being captured in a field
`mathod`.

See if you can spot the typo, once it's fixed we can run
`vector test ./vector.toml` again and we should get this:

```text
Running vector.toml tests
test vector.toml: test apache regex ... passed
```

Success! Next, try experimenting by adding more [transforms][docs.transforms] to
your pipeline before moving onto the next guide.

<Alert type="info">

While we're at, did you know you can control all of Vector's field names via
the [global `log_schema` options][docs.reference.global-options#log_schema]?
Vector does not lock you into any specific schema.

## Next Steps

Now that you're a Vector pro you'll have endless ragtag groups of misfits
trying to recruit you as their hacker, but it won't mean much if you can't
deploy Vector. Onto the next guide!
