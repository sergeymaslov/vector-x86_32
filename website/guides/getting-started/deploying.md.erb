What good is Vector if you can't deploy it?! Fortunately, deploying Vector is
easy. Vector is written in [Rust][urls.rust] and compiles to a single static
binary. Meaning there are no dependencies or runtime, making the actual act of
installing Vector as easy as copying the binary to your target host. Beyond
that, you'll want to think strategically about _how_ you deploy Vector. This is
where the magic lies and this is precisely what this guide will touch on.

## Basic Concepts

Before we get into the [installation tutorial](#tutorial), let's touch on some
basic Vector deployment concepts. We've had the fortunate opportunity of working
with many different companies deploying Vector, and all of their approaches
can be broken down into two basic concepts: [strategies](#strategies) and
[topologies](#topologies).

### Strategies

Strategies refer to data collection on a _single_ host. It's the very first
thing you'll think about when deploying Vector. For example, are you
operationally proficient and comfortable installing Vector directly on each of
your host? Or are you an app developer only concerned with data collection for
your service? Each context requires a different deployment strategy! To solve
this, we've broken down deploying Vector into three basic strategies. These
are best explained with diagrams, and [covered in more detail][docs.strategies]
in our docs.

### Topologies

Topologies refer to the high-level network that your Vector instances create
to get data from A to B -- the zoomed out perspective. This, again, is largely
dependent on your environment and downstream storages. We've broken these
down into three basic examples. Use these as _guidelines_ to form your own
topology. These are best explained with diagrams, and [covered in more
detail][docs.topologies] in our docs.

## Tutorial

Now it's time to get to business! This tutorial will walk through the simple
act of deploying Vector within your environment.
