As part of our recent Lua improvements we've defaulted the `search_dirs` option
to the same directory as your Vector configuration file(s). This is usually
what's expected and allows you to place all of your Vector related files
together.

## Upgrade Guide

Make the following changes in your `vector.toml` file if your Lua files are not
in the same directory as your Vector configuration file:

```diff title="vector.toml"
 [transform.my-script]
   type = "lua"
+  search_dirs = "/my/other/dir"
```

That's it!
