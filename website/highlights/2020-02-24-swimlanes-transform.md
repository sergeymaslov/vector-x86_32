The new [`swimlanes` transform][docs.transforms.swimlanes] makes it much easier
to configure conditional branches of transforms and sinks. For example, you can
easily create [if/else pipelines][docs.transforms.swimlanes#examples].

```toml title="vector.toml"
[transforms.lanes]
  types = "swimlanes"

  [transforms.my_transform_id.lanes.errors]
    "level.eq" = "error"

  [transforms.my_transform_id.lanes.not_errors]
    "level.neq" = "error"
```

Remember to occasionally let your branches mingle so that they don't completely
lose touch.
