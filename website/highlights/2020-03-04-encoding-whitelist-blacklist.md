We've added the ability to whitelist and blacklist fields during the encoding
process within [sinks][docs.sinks]. This is useful if you have metadata fields
that you do not want to send downstream. For example, you might have an
`application_id` fields that you use for partitioning, but you don't want to
include it inthe actual data since it would be duplicative.

To use this feature see the new `encoding` options for each sink. For example,
the [`clickhouse` sink's `encoding` option][docs.sinks.clickhouse#encoding].
