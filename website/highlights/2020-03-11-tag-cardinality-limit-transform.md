High cardinality metric tags can severy disrupt downstream metrics storages. To
protet against this we built a new
[`tag_cardinality_limit` transform][docs.transforms.tag_cardinality_limit].

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. Simply add this component to your pipeline:

```toml title="vector.toml"
[transforms.tag_protection]
  type = "tag_cardinality_limit"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  limit_exceeded_action = "drop_tag"
  mode = "exact"
  value_limit = 500
```

<CodeExplanation>

- The `limit_exceeded_action` described the behavior when the `value_limit` is reached.
- The `mode` enables you to switch between `exact` and `probabilistic` algorithms to trade performance for memory efficiency.
- The `value` limit allows you to select exactly how many unique tag values you're willing to accept.

</CodeExplanation>

More to come! This feature is part of our [best-in-class operator
UX][urls.milestone_39] initiative.
