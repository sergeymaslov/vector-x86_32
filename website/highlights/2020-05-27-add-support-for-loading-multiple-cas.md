Working with `openssl` isn't very fun, and we don't want to inflict that on you. Vector can deal non-trivial cerificate chains now. This means if you have a `.pem` file with 2 chains of 4 certs, well, Vector should be able to work it out.

This is particularly useful if you have a socket source:

```toml title="vector.toml"
[sources.tls]
  type = "socket"
  address = "0.0.0.0:6514"
  mode = "tcp"
  tls.enabled = true
  tls.crt_path = "cert.pfx"
  tls.ca_path = "ca.pem" # Now supported: More complicated PEMS!
  tls.verify_certificate = true
```

If it doesn't, that's a bug. [**Report it.**][urls.new_bug_report] We squash bugs.
